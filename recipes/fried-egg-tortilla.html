    <br><em>A lovely Fried Egg Tortilla</em>

    <p>Fry an egg, melt the cheese, and warm your tortilla all in the same pan. Add your favorite toppings like salsa, jalape√±o pepper slices, cilantro, and green onions and enjoy a great tasting breakfast, done in a flash. Of course, you can repeat, as many times as you like, if you have company.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons butter</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon taco seasoning, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 1/2 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
        <li>1 (6 to 7-inch) flour tortilla</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a 10-inch nonstick skillet, melt butter over medium heat, and swirl the pan to coat the bottom evenly.</li>
        <li>Carefully break egg into buttered skillet and cook until egg white is opaque and egg is firm enough to turn, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Turn egg over, being careful not to break yolk; sprinkle with taco seasoning and about half of cheese.</li>
        <li>Gently place tortilla over egg and cheese, and cook about 1 minute. Using a silicone egg turner, flip the egg and tortilla, as one.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle remaining cheese on top of the egg, and continue cooking until the egg is done to your liking and the tortilla is warm and toasty, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Slide tortilla and egg to a serving plate and serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
